               Haiti is a perfect piece of Caribbean paradise, a stunning, sun-drenched setting straight out of the movies. Sharing the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, this tropical getaway is filled with golden beaches and clear blue water, with stretches of sand winding idyllically for miles on the horizon. Haiti is a top spot to find some of the best beaches in the world, here’s our guide to the 10 best.

           <h2>Wahoo Bay Beach</h2>
           <p>
               The beach off of the Cormier Plage Resort is a hidden paradise. Tourists staying in the hotel have exclusive access to the beachfront, a stretch of sand set in a prime location to visit many Haitian tourist attractions, such as cultural sites like the Citadelle Laferrière. Guests can virtually never leave the beach here by opting to stay in beachfront rooms, an option giving the opportunity to experience the beautiful crashing waves on the silky sand from morning until night.

           <h2>Gelèe Beach</h2>
           <p>
               Located near Les Cayes in southern Haiti, Gelée Beach is one of the most popular beaches in Haiti. Highlights including the beachside fritay merchants and the chance to see cows grazing in fields that reach almost to the water’s edge. Compared to other popular beaches in Haiti, the surrounds are flat and open. Pastoral scenery notwithstanding, the water is tropical and the swimming here is lush.
   
    
   
               The beach itself winds around the southern coastline for miles, with soft, pillowy sand melting into some of the most crystal clear waters you’ll find anywhere on the island – or in the Caribbean, for that matter.
               
               
               Colorful shacks of food vendors dot the treeline. The number of them is a testament to how popular Gelee beach is and how good the seafood is here. If you’ve already tried Haitian cuisine in Port-au-Prince, you’ll be familiar with the fried plantains and meat – typically called fritay, but don’t miss the chance to try the locally-caught seafood.
               
                
               
               If you find the queues for the beachside food overwhelming, you’ll find a choice of restaurants and hotels a short drive from the beach.
               
                
               
               At night, Gelée transforms into a lively, well-lit destination for dinner by the shore. The broad boulevard fills with music and foot traffic. People flock to the beach for Gelée’s specialty - grilled fish with fried plantains. Avoid a long wait by going with a local who can walk right up to their vendor of choice and order the right way
