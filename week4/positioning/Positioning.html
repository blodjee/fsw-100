                         <h1>Citadelle La Ferrière</h1>
                         <h5>DECEMBER 17, 1974</h5>
                         <h5>HISTORY</h5>
                           The Citadelle Laferrière is a mountaintop fortress, located on the northern coast of Haiti - on the top of mountain Bonnet a L’Eveque.

                            Depicted on local currency, stamps and postcards, this amazing structure has become the symbol of Haiti’s power and independence. It was built in the beginning of the 19th century by one of the leaders of Haiti’s slave revolution.
                            
                            The Citadelle Laferrière is also known simply as the Citadelle or as Citadelle Henri Christophe in the honor of its creator.
                            
                            The Citadelle is referred by locals as the Eighth Wonder of the World and in 1982 it was nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This massive stone construction is the largest fortress in the Americas. Built to demonstrate the power of the newly independent Haiti, the Citadelle Laferrière was essential for the security of Haiti’s newly formed state. 
                            
                            The fortress was built for enabling the king to use the so-called scorched earth tactics, i.e. in case of French attack the surrounding territory would be burnt in fire and the local population, the army and the king would find shelter in the unconquerable Citadelle.
                            
                            This massive stone construction was outfitted with 365 cannons of varying size and an enormous stockpile of cannon balls that still can be found in different corners of the Citadelle even today. The cannons were obtained from different monarchs. Today the iron and bronze cannons are still pointing out of the Citadelle’s windows and the visitors of the Citadelle can still see the royal crests of famous European monarchs of 18th century on the cannons.
                            
                            The creators of the Citadelle Laferrière had very creative approach to its appearance. This is not a box-shaped boring construction, but an embodiment of unlimited human imagination. Depending from the angle the Citadelle has different shapes. If the visitors are approaching it by the main trail, leading to the top of the mountain, Citadelle’s appearance resembles the prow of a great stone ship jutting out of the mountain.
                            
                            The fortress has an angular structure, thanks to which its appearance has different forms based on the viewer’s location. Some of the angles have protective character and were designed to deviate the enemy’s cannonballs. This mountaintop fortress includes fortification walls, large storages of food and water, royal mansions, dungeons, bathing quarters, etc. Most of the parts of the fortress have no roofs.
                            
                            This astonishingly huge structure was created by war and for war, but fortunately the attack of French army never came and this amazing fortress survived up to today almost unchanged.
                            
                            Despite the military mission and the atmosphere of war and danger still present in the Citadelle, its windows open an amazing view to the surrounding landscapes.
                            
                            There are fantastic views on three sides of tumbling green peaks and, to the north, Cap-Haïtien, where the streets are lined with colorful shops, watch-menders and old men playing dice.

                         <h5>MARCH 15, 2018 </h5>
                         <h5>PLEASURE</h5>
                     The private port of Labadee, Haiti is leased to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and utilized by cruise ships from Royal Caribbean Cruises and Celebrity Cruises.

                         On a cruise stop at Labadee, Haiti you can hit the sandy beaches, book water sports activities, or take zip line down from the top of a mountain.  Let’s cover some of the basics of this cruise port first.The cruise ships that visit Labadee dock at the pier of the Northernmost part of the island. Although the area is often called a private island, the proper term is a peninsula.

                         Labadee is a private area just for cruise ships and cruisers are not allowed to leave the safe confines of the fenced-in area. The port offers a wide variety of attractions and excursions and most are within a quick walking distance from the pier.If you would like to travel further out, there’s a tram that is available to take you to different areas. Each area is marked, much like a bus stop, which makes it easy for cruisers to see the stops and be able to get to and from their tour or excursion easily. Or, if you are heading to the farthest beach, then taking the ferry will get you there the fastest.For starters, some basics about Labadee and then we will get into some recommendations.It is a a 260-acre private beach resort used exclusively by Royal Caribbean guests and crew members.  Royal Caribbean sister company ships, most notably Celebrity Cruise Line, have also been known to stop there. The Royal Caribbean ships dock right at Labadee, making for an easy on-off experience. You will need to bring your SeaPass card with you when you get off the ship at a minimum, but we recommend bringing a small day bag with you to keep valuables and belongings together.

                         Most times Royal Caribbean provides a towel station on the dock for guests as they exit the ship, but you can alternatively pick up towels to use on the pool deck.  Once off the ship, you will walk down the dock towards land and pass through the Labadee entrance area, which is your gateway to what Labadee offers.  Recently, Royal Caribbean has been offering a water taxi that picks guests up at the dock and takes them directly to Columbus Cove beach, which is the furthest beach to walk to.

        <h1>St Jacques Majeur Fameux Ogou</h1>
            <h5>June 24, 2018 </h5>
            <h5>CULTURE</h5

Geographically, it is part of the National Historic Park (PNH). The northern plain, thanks to the St Jacques or Ogoun basin, is a high place of pilgrimage for Vodouisants who flock there by the thousands on the day of the celebration of Saint Jacques Major which we assimilate to the powerful voodoo spirit Ogoun Ferraille. According to popular belief, a bath in this basin of muddy water reputed to be miraculous, would bring luck, protection, healingThis July 24, 2018, the pilgrims and the Visitors who will go to the North Plain
            will be spoiled they will be able to participate in the country evenings animated by
            Septent and Tropicana, but during the day they can
            rejuvenate historically by going to Bois Caiman where took place in the
            night of August 14 to 15, 1791 the ceremony of the Bois Caïman which was especially the
            culmination of the slave revolt of Santo Domingo. They can
            also attend the Vodou ceremonies which take place in the Ogoun basin
              or go to the locality of Balan to visit the facilities of the

            voodoo symbols, crafts, massage therapy services,
            Balneotherapy and drum lessons ..The Haitian Voodoo originated from West Africa and arrived in in the island during the slave trading days, when the slaves were brought over. Voodoo was able to survive as a religion as well as a culture because it was mixed and integrated with Roman Catholicism from the French plantation owners.

            Because of Hollywood and bigotry, many have identified Voodoo which is beautiful religion and culture with Black magic
            
            Prayers as well as dancing and music are also major elements of the Voodoo ceremony. Animal sacrifice is acommon practice during a Voodoo ceremony. Animals are considered sacred in Voodoo and are used as offerings to the gods and ancestors.
